/**
  DANGERMOON (V2)

  SafeMoon but reflection fees are randomly distributed, instead of evenly.

  Some of you will make it to the moon before others,
  and you will have nothing but the oracles to thank.

  Primary V2 Update:
  The community didn't think it was fair that you could win after selling.
  Now, if you sell, you can no longer win. Up only.
  (V1 visible at 0x612382Be41E6a28A208C3d8912Dd94496f892325)

  ## DANGERMOON features:
  5% fee auto added to the liquidity pool
  5% fee auto added to currentReflection, to be randomly distributed

  ~0.5% of random distributions go to marketing address
  ~1.0% of random distributions go to charity address
  ~1.0% of random distributions go to burn address

  50% of totalSupply is burned at start... for the culture.

  ## CHAINLINK VRF
  Chainlink's verifiable random functions take 10 BSC blocks to respond.
  BSC blocks are ~5 seconds, so at most, there's a distribution every ~50s.
  currentReflection accrues in-between distributions.

  ## HODLING
  If the randomly selected winner has sold any DANGERMOON, the prize pool
  is not distributed. Addresses can donate to burn, marketing, and charity
  addresses ONLY without ruining their chances of winning. Any sell, transfer,
  or send to any other address means your address will one day be on the dapp
  leaderboard with how much you could have won had you HODLed.

  ## REFLECTION SYSTEM
  You can be added to the reflection system by buying a set number of
  DANGERMOON at a time. Make separate purchases to get more than 1 entry.
  Entries are permanent and can receive distributions any number of times,
  until the address sells or transfers any DANGERMOON to an unspecified address.
  _minimumTokensForReflection can be changed as needed to keep the entry price
  attainable.

  ## PAYOUTS
  Contract pays currentReflection non-stop, until it runs out of LINK.
  Then the currentReflection accrues 5% fees, until someone donates 0.2 LINK
  into this contract to initiate a distribution. This LINK fee goes towards
  paying Chainlink for a verifiable random number, on which we determine
  the recipient. This contract gets refunded LINK (from the Chainlink
  team) at the end of every month, and will automatically use the refund to
  continue making more distributions.

  ## RANDOM BURNS
  DANGERMOON deflates itself every time the 0xdead address gets the reflection.
  We grant 1/100 entries to the dead address to ensure we burn at least ~1% of
  prizes. Anyone can donate DANGERMOON to 0xdead to get 2 entries for themselves
  (to incentivize burns), and one entry for 0xdead. When 0xdead wins, it makes
  tokens scarcer for all holders. 0xdead starts with 0 entries.

  It is up to the community to decide the fate of DANGERMOON, from the
  frequency of reflection distributions, to the rate at which it is burned.

/** ****************************************************************************
 * @notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness
 * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not
 * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key
 * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to
 * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely
 * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.
 *
 * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was
 * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,
 * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample
 * @dev from the output space.
 *
 * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts
 * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide
 * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can
 * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as
 * @dev shown:
 *
 * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {
 * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
 * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {
 * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>
 * @dev       }
 * @dev   }
 *
 * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have
 * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK
 * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and
 * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you
 * @dev want to generate randomness from.
 *
 * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response
 * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.
 *
 * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value
 * @dev generated from your seed.
 *
 * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by
 * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent
 * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is
 * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more
 * @dev details. (See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" for principles to keep in mind,
 * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.)
 *
 * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds
 * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the
 * @dev next section.)
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly
 * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that
 * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract
 * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).
 *
 * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free
 * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all
 * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your
 * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or
 * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any
 * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be
 * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.
 *
 * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence
 * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if
 * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,
 * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot
 * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.
 *
 * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the
 * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact
 * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API
 * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.
 *
 * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness
 * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful
 * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block
 * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a
 * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input
 * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic
 * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits
 * @dev until it calls responds to a request.
